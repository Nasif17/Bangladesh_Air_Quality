# Bangladesh Air & Weather Data Collector

This Python script retrieves historical **weather** and **air quality** data for all eight divisions of Bangladesh using the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API.
The data is saved in CSV format for further analysis or visualization.

## Features

* Collects hourly **weather** data:

  * Temperature (°C)
  * Relative Humidity (%)
  * Surface Pressure (hPa)
  * Wind Speed (m/s)

* Collects hourly **air quality** data:

  * European AQI
  * PM2.5, PM10 (µg/m³)
  * NO₂, O₃, CO, SO₂ concentrations

* Covers **all divisions** of Bangladesh:

  * Dhaka, Chattogram, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Barisal, Rangpur, Mymensingh

* Saves results in a **structured CSV** file with timestamps, division, and city.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Required libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install requests pandas
  ```

## How It Works

1. Iterates through each division of Bangladesh with **latitude** and **longitude** coordinates.
2. Fetches weather data from:

   * [Archive API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api)
3. Fetches air quality data from:

   * [Air Quality API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/air-quality-api)
4. Merges both datasets by timestamp.
5. Saves the merged dataset as `bangladesh_air_weather_2025.csv`.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script.
2. Adjust the `start_date` and `end_date` in the script if needed.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. The output file `bangladesh_air_weather_2025.csv` will be generated in the same directory.

## Output Example

| timestamp\_utc         | division | city  | temp\_c | humidity\_pct | pressure\_hpa | wind\_speed\_mps | aqi | pm25 | pm10 | no2 | o3 | co  | so2 |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----- | ------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --- | ---- | ---- | --- | -- | --- | --- |
| 2024-01-01T00:00+00:00 | Dhaka    | Dhaka | 20.5    | 85            | 1012          | 1.2              | 55  | 22   | 40   | 12  | 8  | 0.3 | 2   |

If you’d like, I can also **add a section in the README with a diagram** showing the data flow from the API to the CSV. That would make it visually clear how your script works.
